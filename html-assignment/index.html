        <p>
            This One is a doll. It ( yes, <em>it</em> ) likes cold places, toys, and christmas !
            It has just entered kindergarten, which has been an exciting, albeit scary, experience.

            theres a kind of beauty standing on the edge of the roof of a 20 storey building at night. there's so much life in your field of view. much of its resting, preparing for another day. its beautiful how it manages to all work together. i love it.

            This One is a bit of an art slut and loves being creative 
            and attempting fun projects. It's currently doing a lot with 
            local databases for home automation and CSS 3D rendering 
            tricks.
